https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/leaving-trump-rallies-early,"The line to get into the Donald Trump rally snaked about a quarter-mile around the venue in Marietta, Georgia, on Tuesday, an hour before the event started.

The hall, which seats 2,700 people, had already started filling up with supporters, the first of whom arrived around 1pm for the 7.30pm event. Not everyone was getting in.

There’s no shortage of political enthusiasm in Georgia. Early voting opened on Tuesday, with 310,980 people casting a ballot in person according to the Georgia secretary of state’s office. The previous record was about 130,000. Few of Trump’s supporters sported “I voted” stickers.

Though the energy before the rally was high, many have noted in recent months – including Kamala Harris during the presidential debate last month – that crowds at Trump rallies dwindle as his speeches turn into multi-hour rambles.

“I’m going to actually do something really unusual and I’m going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump’s rallies because it’s a really interesting thing to watch,” Harris said during the debate. “You will see during the course of his rallies he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom.”

The Guardian tested that proposition on Tuesday.

About three out of 10 people attending the rally left before Trump finished speaking at 10.14pm. In their defense, Trump was an hour and a half late.

Seven minutes into Trump’s address, as he recited a litany of grievances about inflation, schools, the quality of cars, cities, immigration and the prospect of a third world war, a dozen people had already walked out.

Twenty minutes in, as Trump was describing how “murderers” immigrating illegally posed a bigger threat to America than inflation, Ryan Taylor, a podcaster, headed to her car.

“I live an hour away, and my son is waiting in the car,” she said. “He didn’t want to come in. He’s a teenager.” He’s 15, she said.

Haley Lummus, of Jasper, Georgia, left at 9.22pm, just as Trump was describing Harris as the “taxing queen” and complaining about how his attacks on San Francisco depreciate the value of the property he owns there.

“We had to wait a while, like to get him on stage,” she said. “Everyone was doing the wave, and there was a lot of people very excited to see him cheering.” Why was she leaving early? “I worked and I’m tired.”

Perhaps 50 people had left by then.

A group of five young men wearing brand-new red “Make America Great Again” baseball caps walked out just before 9.30, as Trump was claiming that the wars in Ukraine and Gaza would not have happened if he had been president. The five looked mildly bewildered and very slightly out of place, even there.

“We’re from Denmark, and we don’t really care about American politics at all, but we wanted to experience American politics firsthand,” said Gustave. He and his friends were staying about 15 minutes away, heard about Trump’s appearance and said why not. They described the event as a “fever dream” and “something like The Bachelor” before heading off to beat traffic.

Another 50 or so left over the next 10 minutes. Four of them were thrown out.

“Some of us went in with flags to scream, ‘Free Palestine’.” said one young man who wouldn’t identify himself. Trump was talking about ending taxes on tips. “The flags got snatched from us. We got booed. We got kicked. I still support Trump though.” They complained that the burly security guard in front of them roughed them up, taunting him as they ambled on the periphery of the hall. A few minutes later, Secret Service agents arrested one of them.

By 9.50, as Trump was talking about how the “migrant invasion” was “stealing American jobs”, a consistent stream of people hit the exits. Most said they had to work the next day, or had a babysitter to relieve. Marietta is a metro Atlanta city, while Trump’s base of support often lives in more rural communities a distance away.

Season Poole, once an army diesel mechanic, lives in Social Circle, Georgia. This was her second rally; she attended one in North Carolina two weeks ago, she said. As Trump described “alien gang members and migrant criminals from prison”, Poole contemplated schoolwork and an hour drive.

At least 500 people had left by then. Voni Miller would have stayed if she could.

“He made me cry,” Miller said. “I cried when he was speaking about making changes. You know, closing the border, making changes. If Kamala wins we’re so screwed, because she can’t make up her mind about anything. It just made me cry because he’s giving up so much. He doesn’t have to do this for us. Like, you know what I mean. He has all the money, but he is still getting shot at, and people saying horrible things about him. But he’s doing it because he wants to make changes for America, and it was just so emotional.”

So. Why leave?

“I’m actually leaving early because my phone is dying and I have a Tesla so I can’t get in. It’s really upsetting, because it meant a lot to be here, and I just can’t get in my car.”

By 10.05, as Trump was talking about how important it was for police officers to be shielded from civil suits in misconduct cases for “doing something good”, Trump had lost about a third of his audience.

Stephen Rosenbaum was walking back to his car with his son at that point. “I think I get more out of these rallies than anything else, and I hope that other people do,” he said. “He shows the human side. You know, we watched the Butler rally live on television when it happened. It was terrible,” he said about the first assassination attempt on Trump. “But, you know, right before all those events took place, he said, Listen, we just want to make the country a better place.”

Rosenbaum has been to several rallies, he said.

“We wanted to see that, see it in real life. We want to see it live,” he said. But, you’re not staying for the whole thing? “He’s got to go to school tomorrow. And he’s gotten to the part now where, I mean, we’ve seen enough of these. We kind of know how it’s going to finish. We just wanted to see it live.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/16/justin-trudeau-testimony-india,"Justin Trudeau has accused India of making a “horrific mistake” in violating Canadian sovereignty, amid an escalating diplomatic row over the murder of a Sikh separatist in British Columbia and allegations of a broader campaign of threats and violence against Indian exiles.

Testifying at a public inquiry into foreign interference on Wednesday, the Canadian prime minister accused Delhi of rebuffing efforts to cooperate and causing the increasingly bitter public feud that resulted in the mutual expulsion of senior diplomats on Monday.

“We are not looking to provoke or create a fight with India,” Trudeau said. “The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada. We need to respond in order to ensure Canadians’ safety.”

In his most detailed remarks on the saga so far, Trudeau said Canada had not wanted to “blow up” its valuable relationship with India.

But he said that after Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia last June, “we had clear and certainly now ever clearer indications that India had violated Canada’s sovereignty.”

Trudeau made a number of explosive statements, including claims that highly classified intelligence suggested members of the opposition Conservative party were “engaged, or at high risk of” being a part of foreign interference efforts.

His comments came in a tumultuous week in which Canadian police accused the Indian diplomats of working with a criminal network led by a notorious imprisoned gangster to target Sikh dissidents in the country. India has rejected the allegations as “ludicrous”.

Responding to Trudeau’s comments, a spokesperson for India’s ministry of external affairs said: “What we have heard today only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along – Canada has presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats. The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone.”

Trudeau said Canadian officials privately shared evidence with their Indian counterparts who, he said, have been uncooperative.



“The decision by the RCMP to go forward with that announcement was entirely anchored in public safety and a goal of disrupting the chain of activities that was resulting in drive-by shootings, home invasions, violent extortion and even murder in and across Canada,” Trudeau said.

The prime minister said Canadian authorities first raised the Nijjar murder during the 2023 G20 summit in New Delhi. Officials working “behind the scenes” told the Indians “there are real concerns that your security agencies were involved in the killing”, he said.

But when Trudeau confronted Narendra Modi on the final day of the summit, he was told by the Indian prime minister that Canada should do more to crack down on Sikh separatists, he said.

And despite Canadian efforts to engage with Indian officials, Trudeau said, they appeared uninterested in “taking the off-ramp” offered.

Since Trudeau first told parliament of “credible allegations potentially linking” the Indian government and Nijjar’s murder, Ottawa and Delhi have been locked in an worsening feud over the issue.

India temporarily stopped issuing in visas in Canada, and on Monday Canada expelled six senior diplomats, including the high commissioner, Sanjay Verma. India retaliated by ordering the expulsion of six high-ranking Canadian diplomats, including the acting high commissioner.

Trudeau’s latest statement comes as Canada seeks to convince allied nations to also condemn India’s alleged actions – an effort that has so far produced mixed results.

Earlier on Wednesday, the UK called on India to co-operate with Canadian legal authorities to investigate the allegations, following a phone call between Trudeau and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer.

The British Foreign Office said: “We are in contact with our Canadian partners about the serious developments outlined in the independent investigations in Canada. The UK has full confidence in Canada’s judicial system … The government of India’s cooperation with Canada’s legal process is the right next step.”

As Canada’s allegations have broadened, it has become more difficult for its allies in the Five Eyes intelligence partnership to remain silent.

Canada’s federal police force on Monday alleged that Indian diplomats have worked with criminal gangs to orchestrate a campaign of extortion, intimidation and coercion against members of the Canadian south Asian community, resulting in homicides, home invasions, drive-by shootings and arson. Since September 2023, at least 13 people have been “warned by the RCMP of grave threats against them” according to a coalition of lawmakers.

The US has repeatedly said that New Delhi is not cooperating with Canada’s investigation, but the state department said on Wednesday that it was satisfied with India’s cooperation in a separate case involving an alleged plot against a Sikh separatist leader in New York last year.

Washington has alleged that Indian agents were involved in the attempted assassination of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, and has indicted an Indian national working at the behest of an unnamed Indian government official.

An Indian government committee investigating the foiled murder plot met US officials in Washington, for a meeting the state department described as “productive”.

During his testimony, Trudeau also warned Tory lawmakers were involved in, or vulnerable to, foreign interference.

“I have the names of a number of parliamentarians, former parliamentarians and/or candidates in the Conservative party of Canada who are engaged [in] or at high risk of or for whom there is clear intelligence around foreign interference,” Trudeau said.

The Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has so far refused to get the security clearance necessary to be briefed the full scope of his party’s involvement, Trudeau said.

Trudeau also told the commission parliament’s national security and intelligence committee found evidence of foreign interference during the Tory leadership convention, which Poilievre won in 2022.

“The fact that there is absolutely no curiosity or openness in trying to figure out what happened or whether someone was compromised or whether a foreign country impacted those leadership races is simply irresponsible,” Trudeau said.

In a statement, Poilievre called on Trudeau to name the compromised lawmakers, and accused the prime minister of “lying to distract from a Liberal caucus revolt against his leadership and revelations he knowingly allowed Beijing to interfere and help him win two elections”.

Trudeau told the commission said he received intelligence in his role as prime minister but did not use it for “partisan” benefit. “I don’t believe in using national security information for partisan purposes,” he said.

https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/16/when-veneers-go-very-wrong-i-knew-id-made-the-biggest-mistake-of-my-life,"Catherine thought she was being smart when she chose a clinic near Harley Street, the London address long synonymous with high-end private healthcare. She was in her early 30s and wanted to improve her smile. At least, looking back now – after all the pain, the nightmares and the legal fees – she thought she did.

“With hindsight, my teeth weren’t actually that bad,” Catherine (not her real name) says. “But they were quite gappy. I didn’t have the confidence to smile in photographs and used to talk with my hand over my mouth. And then I saw this voucher deal. That’s when I took the plunge.”

The offer was for veneers, a cosmetic treatment that is in soaring demand as part of a wider boom in cosmetic dentistry. They have become a shortcut to what used to be known as a Hollywood smile but could now be called the Love Island smile, such is the unnatural perfection of even non-celebrity teeth on reality TV and social media.

I didn’t have the confidence to smile in photographs and I used to talk with my hand over my mouth. Then I saw this voucher deal. That’s when I took the plunge

Veneers can be sculpted from resin or applied like false nails. For a cost that can be more than £1,000 a tooth, you can choose your shade of white, while increasing the surface area of the tooth to close gaps or create neatly aligned edges that would be the envy of an ancient Greek stonemason.

Veneers were indeed born in Hollywood, where dentists were recruited to, for example, fill the gap in Judy Garland’s front teeth or help with continuity when Shirley Temple’s baby teeth fell out. They used acrylic or denture powder to make these temporary fixes. By the 1980s solid veneers had been developed and the movie stars of the 90s redefined the perfect smile.

There are no statistics on the demand for veneers today, but dentists who dabble in cosmetic work say veneers have become as routine as Botox or lip filler for people with cash to burn who would once have tolerated or ignored crooked gnashers. For so long the butt of jokes for their charming disorder, British teeth are not what they used to be.

“There is a huge demand for veneers that is largely driven by social media and this desire for anatomically symmetrical white smiles,” says Anshu Sood, a co-owner of Helix House Orthodontics, a clinic in Nottingham.

Sood specialises in moving teeth, but has expanded what Helix House offers to meet rising demand for veneers as a follow-up to braces. She says patients want to transform more than just “the social six” – the upper front teeth most visible in a smile. “Now they want everything straightened, they want a wider smile,” she says.

Sam Jethwa, the founder of Bespoke Smile, a clinic and training academy in central London and Marlow, Buckinghamshire, has fitted more than 10,000 veneers in his time. “We now do around 80 new consultations a month, and place around 1,500 veneers a year,” he says.

Jethwa, who is also president-elect of the British Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, says veneer consultations have quadrupled in the past four years. “We’re noticing increasing numbers of male patients,” he adds.

Costs vary according to the material used. Most in demand are porcelain veneers, which are half a millimetre thick and made in a lab. Fitting them generally requires what should be minimal preparation of the teeth, using a drill, before they are chemically bonded with a specialist glue. A cheaper alternative uses a composite resin, which can be applied as 3D-printed veneers or sculpted directly on the teeth.

Robbie Hughes, a dentist and the principal director of Dental Excellence UK, a clinic in Liverpool that has become popular with Premier League footballers (he’s responsible for ex-Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp’s dazzling smile), says veneers for 20 teeth cost from about £7,000 using composites to £20,000 for porcelain veneers. His patients tend to be aged 20 to 40, and 40% are men.

Demand has increased for ever-whiter veneers as patients want to show off teeth that are obviously the result of expensive work. Sood says this has further skewed perception of what “perfect” teeth should look like. Hughes, who has noticed a recent trend for more natural shades, also did Roberto Firmino’s teeth. He says the Brazilian former Liverpool player pointed to a space beyond the whitest end of a porcelain colour chart and asked for “maximo”.

All the dentists I speak to say coronavirus boosted demand as home working induced a bout of self-scrutiny in mirrors and video calls. In a pattern that has applied to a whole range of cosmetic treatments, less talented or scrupulous practitioners have raced to meet the demand by competing on price and investing in social media marketing.

Catherine’s deal for several front teeth meant they were half the price she might otherwise have paid. She was impressed by the clinic’s equipment and decor. “And the dentist appeared to know what they were talking about,” she says. She went in for a consultation so that the veneers could be made, and returned to have them fitted over several hours.

The dentist set to work with a drill, but ground away far too much of Catherine’s teeth. “They showed me them in a mirror before the veneers went on and I looked like a witch,” she says. The dentist had left small pegs where Catherine’s healthy teeth had been. When the veeners were applied, her mouth wouldn’t close properly, so the dentist started to shave down her bottom teeth to make room.

I was hysterical. I couldn’t stop crying. The treatment was so rough and I knew I’d made the biggest mistake of my life

“I was hysterical. I couldn’t stop crying,” recalls Catherine, who owns a small business in the south of England. “The treatment was so rough and I was so upset because I knew I’d made the biggest mistake of my life.”

When the painkillers wore off, Catherine says she couldn’t eat properly. Her veneers started to fall off, revealing the “witchy” pegs. Fearing that repairs elsewhere would cost her thousands more, she reluctantly returned to Harley Street to have the veneers refitted. Later, when one tooth split while Catherine was eating, she made an emergency visit to a local dentist.

“That’s when everything started unravelling. He was so shocked,” she says. The new dentist told her the wrong kind of glue had been used for the wrong veneers, and that her existing teeth had been horribly overprepared. “He said they were an absolute mess.”

He took pity on her and charged Catherine the same reduced price to have her veneers done properly. When the original dentist ignored Catherine’s demands for a refund, she contacted Russell Sutton, a solicitor who is in growing demand among the victims of botched cosmetic dentistry.

“It can be tempting for these dentists to take a few thousand pounds off young people and do a half-arsed job and leave them in the lurch, because it’s good quick money for them,” says Sutton, who set up TJL Solicitors in Manchester in 2000.

Christopher Dean, a dentist turned solicitor at the Dental Law Partnership, says the firm receives about five inquiries a week about badly fitted porcelain veneers, 30% more than last year. He describes a case in which a patient’s front teeth had been so overdrilled that the dentist had exposed the internal pulp chambers containing blood vessels and nerves.

Meanwhile, inquiries from unhappy customers to the General Dental Council (GDC), which regulates UK dentists and dental health professionals, doubled from just over 2,000 in 2018 to more than 4,000 in 2022.

Sutton took Catherine’s case but warns that legal routes to compensation are out of reach for many people. He and Dean operate on a no-win, no-fee basis, meaning they will only take cases they are confident they can win, and where the payout is likely to be significantly more than their fees, which can amount to £20,000. This also requires the dentist to have the proper insurance to cover a payout.

Lawyers in the UK won’t touch a patient who has suffered from bad treatment abroad, which is a growing problem for a whole range of cosmetic work. “Choose your jurisdiction carefully,” says Dean, whose firm routinely turns away regretful dental tourists.

Turkey in particular has emerged as a centre for cosmetic work. The briefest online search shows numerous deals for veneers costing as little as €100 (£83) a tooth, or packages including up to 20 teeth, as well as flights and hotels, for a few thousand pounds.

Some of the social media and reality TV stars who have fuelled the trend for “Turkey teeth” have talked about their regrets. Jack Fincham’s smile helped him to victory on Love Island in 2018. He had gone to Turkey six months earlier and was soon inundated on Instagram by fans asking him about his teeth.

Yet Fincham later admitted he had not done his research. The term “veneers” is often used to describe far more invasive crowns, which is what he had. To fit crowns – caps designed to fit over an entire tooth, typically when it is badly decayed or damaged – dentists must first reduce the teeth to pegs to make space. And, Dean says, even when a crown is done perfectly, there’s a risk that it will kill the tooth.

For every veneer horror story, there are no doubt several more patients who are delighted. “They look fantastic!” says Neil Fowler, who had his “social six” done at a Brighton clinic several years ago when he became conscious of his wonky teeth in business meetings. “I’m confident anyway but it definitely made me feel better to suddenly go from crooked, slightly yellow teeth to a Hollywood smile.”

Patients with problems typically visit their local NHS dentist. Dean says the NHS is obliged to carry out any emergency treatment to rescue dying teeth, for example (but not, say, to fit replacement porcelain veneers). The NHS says its dentists are feeling the effects of botched work in other countries. “This puts unplanned pressure on dental teams who are working hard to deliver essential care for patients within the NHS,” says Jason Wong, the chief dental officer for England.

Even perfect treatment locks patients into a lifelong cycle of costly replacements. At best, Hughes says, a good, well-maintained porcelain veneer (perfect hygiene, no chomping on toffees) can last 15 to 20 years. It can often be less, and as little as a few years before cheaper composites start to leak, crack or fall off. “I once accidentally swallowed one in a New York bakery,” Fowler says. “I don’t need to go into the details but let’s just say it’s back in my mouth now.”

I think I’ve got PTSD from it all. Even now I won’t bite into food and have nightmares that my teeth are falling out

Regardless of the material or lifespan, the damage that bonding does to enamel means there’s no going back to natural teeth once veneers have been fitted – something dentists tell me impressionable young patients don’t always consider. Returning to a less skilled dentist for replacements can compound the problem. “To get a good bond the second time round, they remove more tooth, and perhaps all of the enamel,” Dean says. “So then you’re into dentine, which is the inner core of the crown of the tooth, and you can’t glue to that as effectively.”

Dean says crowns are then often the only solution, with the risk of tooth failure and ultimately the need for implants (typically £2,000-3,000 each). “And these were healthy teeth to start off with,” he says, telling me he advises anyone wanting to improve their smile to consider bleaching and braces instead.

It took Catherine more than a year to get a payout from her first dentist’s insurer. She isn’t rich, but has the confidence to know she will be able to afford replacements when the time comes. She was also relieved to learn that, in an unrelated case, the dentist was struck off by the GDC.

But money and a sense of justice have done nothing to banish her memories of a botched treatment, or the knowledge that her teeth have been ruined. “I think I’ve got PTSD from it all,” she says. “Even now I won’t bite into food and have nightmares that my teeth are falling out. I feel really angry about the whole thing.” She says she enjoys her smile now, but tells friends and colleagues who are considering veneers to think twice. “I just say, leave them alone, because once they’re gone, they’re gone.”",catherine thought smart chose clinic near harley street london address long synonymous highend private healthcare early 30s wanted improve smile least looking back – pain

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/16/russia-suspected-of-planting-device-on-plane-that-caused-uk-warehouse-fire,"Counter-terrorism police are investigating whether Russian spies planted an incendiary device on a plane to Britain that later caught fire at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham, the Guardian can reveal.

Nobody was reported injured in the fire on 22 July at a warehouse in the suburb of Minworth that handles parcels for delivery, and the blaze was dealt with by the local fire brigade and by staff.

The parcel is believed to have arrived at the DHL warehouse by air, though it is not known if it was a cargo or passenger aircraft, nor where it was destined for. There could have been serious consequences if it had ignited during the flight.

A similar incident occurred in Germany, also in late July, when a suspect package bound for a flight caught fire at another DHL facility in Leipzig, and investigators are looking at links between the two. German authorities warned this week that had the parcel caught fire mid-air it could have downed the plane.

Thomas Haldenwang, the head of Germany’s domestic intelligence service, told members of the country’s parliament on Monday that had the Leipzig package started burning during a flight “it would have resulted in a crash”.

However, the incident in Birmingham was only disclosed after joint inquiries by the Guardian and German broadcasters WDR and NDR, prompting questions as to why the authorities did not reveal it earlier.

A Metropolitan police counter-terrorism spokesperson said: “We can confirm that officers from counter-terrorism policing are investigating an incident at a commercial premises in Midpoint Way, Minworth.

“On Monday 22 July, a package at the location caught alight. It was dealt with by staff and the local fire brigade at the time and there were no reports of any injuries or significant damage caused.”

British investigators suspect that the incendiary device is part of a wider campaign that Russian spies have been carrying out across Europe this year, which has been condemned as rash and careless by spy chiefs in the UK and elsewhere.

Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, warned last week that Russia’s GRU military intelligence appeared to be on “a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets: we’ve seen arson, sabotage and more”.

The British spy chief accused Russia of engaging in “dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness” and argued that the plotting was counter-productive for the Kremlin because it was “driving increased operational coordination with partners across Europe and beyond”.

Russia’s motive appears to have been to try to inflict a cost on western allies of Ukraine, though the plots are at times precise and at others poorly coordinated and amateurish. But the Kremlin usually denies it is engaged in sabotage activity and has in the past dismissed its accusers of engaging in conspiracy theories.

A warehouse in east London belonging to a company linked to Ukraine caught fire in a suspected arson attack in March. Seven men have been charged with involvement in the incident, which has been linked to a Russian plot.

A shopping centre in Warsaw was destroyed by a fire in May. Shortly after, Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said was “quite likely” that the blaze was caused by operatives from Russia’s intelligence services.

However, the most serious plot uncovered was an attempt to assassinate Armin Papperger, the chief executive of the German arms maker Rheinmetall. In July, it was reported that US intelligence services had foiled Russian plans to murder him.

Met counter-terrorism police are leading the Birmingham investigation with support from specialist officers from the West Midlands, and are comparing notes with investigators around Europe.

Last month, DHL said the package that started burning in Germany was originally posted from Lithuania. The company said at the time it had tightened “security protocols and procedures” in line with advice from European authorities.

The German newspaper Tagesspiegel reported that the incendiary device had started burning in Leipzig as it was about to be loaded on a cargo plane. The flight had been delayed. If the plane taken off on time, it would have ignited mid-air.

If a Russian connection to Birmingham or Leipzig incidents is proved, it is not immediately obvious what plotters were seeking to achieve. Any plot that would have led to the bringing down of a plane would have attracted widespread international condemnation.

Though Haldenwang did not say Russia was behind the German fire when he gave evidence at the Bundestag, he accused the Kremlin’s spy agencies of engaging in “aggressive behaviour” that was “putting people’s lives at risk”.

No arrests have been made in relation to the Birmingham fire, and British police inquiries are continuing. “Officers are liaising with other European law enforcement partners to identify whether this may or may not be connected to any other similar-type incidents across Europe,” the police spokesperson said.

Approached for comment, DHL said it was taking action “to secure its network, staff and assets as well as customer shipments” in reaction to what it described as “ongoing investigations by authorities from several countries”.",counterterrorism police investigating whether russian spies planted incendiary device plane britain later caught fire dhl warehouse birmingham guardian reveal nobody reported injured fire 22 july warehouse suburb minworth handles parcels delivery blaze dealt local fire brigade staff parcel believed arrived dhl warehouse air though known cargo passenger aircraft destined could serious consequences ignited flight similar incident occurred germany also late july suspect package bound flight caught fire another dhl facility leipzig investigators looking links two german authorities warned week parcel caught fire midair could downed plane thomas haldenwang head germany ’ domestic intelligence service told members country ’ parliament monday leipzig package started burning flight “ would resulted crash ” however incident birmingham disclosed joint inquiries guardian german broadcasters wdr ndr prompting questions authorities reveal earlier metropolitan police counterterrorism spokesperson said “ confirm officers counterterrorism policing investigating incident commercial premises midpoint way minworth “ monday 22 july package location caught alight dealt staff local fire brigade time reports injuries significant damage caused ” british investigators suspect incendiary device part wider campaign russian spies carrying across europe year condemned rash careless spy chiefs uk elsewhere ken mccallum head mi5 warned last week russia ’ gru military intelligence appeared “ sustained mission generate mayhem british european streets ’ seen arson sabotage ” british spy chief accused russia engaging “ dangerous actions conducted increasing recklessness ” argued plotting counterproductive kremlin “ driving increased operational coordination partners across europe beyond ” russia ’ motive appears try inflict cost western allies ukraine though plots times precise others poorly coordinated amateurish kremlin usually denies engaged sabotage activity past dismissed accusers engaging conspiracy theories warehouse east london belonging company linked ukraine caught fire suspected arson attack march seven men charged involvement incident linked russian plot shopping centre warsaw destroyed fire may shortly poland ’ prime minister donald tusk said “ quite likely ” blaze caused operatives russia ’ intelligence services however serious plot uncovered attempt assassinate armin papperger chief executive german arms maker rheinmetall july reported us intelligence services foiled russian plans murder met counterterrorism police leading birmingham investigation support specialist officers west midlands comparing notes investigators around europe last month dhl said package started burning germany originally posted lithuania company said time tightened “ security protocols procedures ” line advice european authorities german newspaper tagesspiegel reported incendiary device started burning leipzig loaded cargo plane flight delayed plane taken time would ignited midair russian connection birmingham leipzig incidents proved immediately obvious plotters seeking achieve plot would led bringing plane would attracted widespread international condemnation though haldenwang say russia behind german fire gave evidence bundestag accused kremlin ’ spy agencies engaging “ aggressive behaviour ” “ putting people ’ lives risk ” arrests made relation birmingham fire british police inquiries continuing “ officers liaising european law enforcement partners identify whether may may connected similartype incidents across europe ” police spokesperson said approached comment dhl said taking action “ secure network staff assets well customer shipments ” reaction described “ ongoing investigations authorities several countries ”,0.002012072434607646,-0.9948
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/16/liam-payne-former-one-direction-singer-dies-aged-31,"Liam Payne, a former member of the boyband One Direction, has died aged 31 after falling from a third floor hotel room in Buenos Aires, police have confirmed.

The singer died on Wednesday at 5pm local time.

“Liam James Payne, composer and guitarist, former member of the band One Direction, died today after falling from the third floor of a hotel in Palermo,” Buenos Aires police said in a statement.

Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, told Argentina’s Todo Noticias TV channel that Payne had fallen into an internal courtyard at the hotel.

“A few minutes later [an] emergency team arrived and confirmed the death of this man who we later learned was from a musical group. He had injuries incompatible with life as a result of his fall. There was no way to do anything,” Crescenti said.

Crescenti said authorities were investigating the circumstances of Payne’s death and conducting an autopsy.

Payne had been visiting Argentina along with his former bandmate Niall Horan, who performed at the city’s Movistar Arena on 2 October. Payne was seen dancing and singing along with Horan’s fans at the concert.

Hundreds of fans gathered outside the hotel on Wednesday evening, where police sectioned off the entrance with tape.

A quiet disbelief hung over the street. Supporters stood in shock, many of them in tears as they consoled one another. Others stared up at the hotel, of which all the curtains were closed.

“I’m feeling heartbroken. I remember when I was a kid I had a lot of bullying in my school and his songs helped. I’m devastated. I came as soon as I heard the news,” said 26-year-old fan Martina Belaustgui. “I saw him at Niall’s show a few weeks ago. He was singing and dancing and jumping.”

“I met him when I was 12. He was with his family and I asked for a picture. He was so nice. I was so shy, he tried to talk to me but I couldn’t say anything. I regret that,” said 25-year-old fan Mariana Pinto.

Born in Wolverhampton, England in 1993, Payne was just 16 years old when he became part of One Direction, a boyband formed by music executive Simon Cowell on British reality show The X Factor in 2010.

The band, which consisted of Payne, Horan, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik, didn’t win that season of The X Factor, but went on to become one of the biggest boybands of all time.

They sold more than 70m records worldwide, with hits including What Makes You Beautiful, Night Changes and Steal My Girl.

One Direction went on an indefinite hiatus in 2016, and Payne signed a solo act, releasing his debut single, Strip That Down featuring Quavo, the following year. Other hit songs including Strip That Down, which peaked at No 10 on the US Billboard charts, For You with Rita Ora and Get Low with Zedd.

Speaking to the Guardian in 2019, Payne opened up about his mental health, revealing that he’d been in therapy for two years. He said that, at the height of One Direction’s fame, he began using alcohol and an epilepsy drug as a mood stabiliser, to counter the “erratic highs and lows” he was experiencing. “I just needed a little bit of help to keep me stable … it was very touch and go at times,” he said.

Last year, he said in an interview that he’d completed more than three months of sobriety. “I’m sober now, over 100 days,” he told IFL TV. “I feel amazing, I feel really, really good and the support from the fans has been really, really good, so I’m super happy.”

Payne became a father in 2017, having a son Bear Grey Payne with his then-partner, the X Factor judge Cheryl Cole. The couple split in 2018 after two years together.

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/16/rishi-sunak-starmer-startled-pmqs,"It’s generally not hard to read a politician. You instinctively know when they are being sincere and when they are bullshitting. When push comes to shove, they just aren’t as smart as they would like us to believe they are. They are inherently bad actors. The only people they ever fool are themselves. You know the form. We could all tell when Boris Johnson was lying. It was whenever his lips moved.

But there are the odd moments when they are impossible to read. When no one can really be sure what is going on. Are they playing a sophisticated triple bluff? Or have they entered a parallel universe where they are so detached from reality that even they have no idea what they are doing? Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions was a case in point. One for the connoisseur of madness.

It had seemed a fair bet that Rishi Sunak would seek to embarrass Keir Starmer over the Taylor Swift freebies. After all, this hasn’t been Labour’s finest hour. Allowing a virtual non-story to run for the best part of a week.

We’ve now reached the point where the Tory press – some of whom were at the Wembley gig on a freebie themselves – have concluded that the prime minister masterminded the Vienna bomb threat so he could organise blue-light travel in exchange for 10 minutes face time with Taylor. “I love your work.” “Who are you, again?” Awks. Obviously I would have told her to take the Jubilee line on the tube like everyone else. Or take the bus. Be good for her to see how normal people live.

Quite why it has taken Labour more than a week to get its story on the Taylor Swift gig straight is anyone’s guess. And now we’ll never know, as the leader of the opposition didn’t think to ask. There again, I seem to be about the only person in Westminster who wasn’t offered a freebie – or maybe I was, and just deleted the email as I really wasn’t that bothered. Three hours is a long time to stand up and watch a dot move about on stage.

Nor did Rish! seek to have a go at Labour over national insurance. Starmer’s recent protestations, that when he had insisted that the rates of NI would remain unchanged he hadn’t intended anyone to actually believe him, haven’t been his finest hour. We’re now expected to believe that we all knew Labour was only referring to personal contributions to NI and that it was obvious he planned to increase employers’ contributions. Which invariably get passed on to employees.

Silly, silly us for taking Keir at his word. It reminded me of the time I pointed out to a builder that the kitchen floor he had laid was not level. “Ah,” he said. “You never told me that you wanted it to be DEAD level.” That was a lesson that cost me another several hundred quid.

Quite why Starmer can’t come clean on tax is mystifying. Just reverse the cuts to NI that the Tories made as a desperate election bribe. Tell us they were unaffordable. We would all accept that. It’s no less than the truth. But third-rate deception is all we got.

But instead of addressing any of that, what we got were six questions on China. WTF?? No one could quite work out what was going on. Tory backbenchers looked pained. A rare feelgood opportunity had gone begging. Labour MPs couldn’t believe their luck. In a way it was quite reassuring to see that Sunak had a serious side. After all, he had never shown much interest in international relations when he was prime minister.

More likely, though, Rish! has entirely disengaged. Not just as leader of the opposition but from politics completely. Can’t even bring himself to do a couple of hours preparation for what would be his penultimate PMQs. He’s already checked out. Not long to wait until he can put his feet up for good on a California beach. A chance to enjoy all that money that someone else has earned for him. Nice work if you can get it.

Keir just looked more startled than usual. He would have to wing this one as no one had briefed him on anything to do with China. Just remember to say that China was bad without promising to do anything that might annoy the Chinese. That’s about the full extent of our diplomacy with President Xi.

“Chinese activity near Taiwan is not conducive to peace and stability,” Starmer said. No shit. This was international relations for dummies. Would he condemn the Chinese for clamping down on democracy in Hong Kong? Mmm. Yes, on balance he thought he just might.

We all kept on waiting. Waiting for the killer question. The one that would make sense of Sunak’s sudden interest in China. But it never came. There was even less to see than met the eye.

Why had the government cancelled the registration scheme for foreign spies? “We haven’t,” said Keir tersely. He just hadn’t implemented the one that the Tories had also failed to implement. Both Labour and the Conservatives have come to the conclusion that the best move in international relations is often to do nothing.

And that was pretty much that. Keir didn’t want to waste his pre-cooked signoff so he just shoe-horned it in regardless. Nothing to do with China or anything that Sunak had asked. Just a tirade about every Tory failure of the past 14 years. Sad face from Rish!. He didn’t know what he had done to cop all that abuse. Come the end, Starmer could only keep saying how shocked he was by everything, while the rest of us wondered what had just taken place. Nothing, probably.

So the Tory party retreated yet again into irrelevance for another week. They are finding opposition tougher than expected. No one is even really that bothered who becomes the next leader of the opposition. Mainly because with the choice narrowed down to KemiKaze and Honest Bob they are screwed whatever they do.

Though Kemi is still the happier of the two. And not just because Michael Fabricant publicly endorsed Jenrick. But also because Honest Bob delivered yet another dreary speech to a crowd of no one. Every time he opens his mouth another of his dreams dies. Today he wasn’t even aware that Thomas Tuchel had been chosen as the next England manager. His horror at a German being in charge momentarily silenced him.

https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/oct/16/king-of-curry-chef-shabir-hussain-dies-age-56,"Shabir Hussain, the celebrity chef known as the “king of curry” who claimed to have invented the “hanging naan”, has died age 56.

Hussain founded a chain of Indian restaurants in the UK and owned dozens of food venues across the north of England, the Midlands and Scotland.

His restaurant, Akbar’s, announced Hussain’s death on its social media on Wednesday and said its establishments would be closed until 5pm on Friday as a result.

“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Shabir Hussain, founder of Akbar’s Restaurant Group,” the post said. “Please remember Shabir Hussain in your prayers. May Allah (SWT) grant him the highest rank in Jannah and bring peace and strength to his family during this difficult time.”

Hussain first opened a 28-seat restaurant in Bradford in 1995 before expanding to cities across the UK, including Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow and Birmingham. He opened his latest restaurant in Blackburn earlier this year.

The chef, who has been described as a “pioneer in the Indian food world”, claimed this year that he had invented the “naan tree”, a vertical metal stand that holds large naans or Asian flatbreads.

Speaking to the CEO Club podcast, Hussain said: “I’m the guy who invented the naan tree – my biggest regret is I could have patented it … It’s actually now used everywhere by everybody.”

The restaurateur said it was initially designed as a “space-saver” that later turned into a “craze”. “People started coming to the restaurant just to see it,” he said.

“The idea was to build a heavy base so it doesn’t fall over, bring it upwards, and in the beginning there was only hooks on one side,” he told the podcast. “Now we put hooks on both sides so you can hang two naans on it.”

The editor of the Asian Standard, Fatima Patel, described Hussain as a “generous and soft human being”.

Speaking to the BBC, Patel said: “He revolutionised the curry industry when he went into it, he created lots of new ways to present curry, not just to the non-Asian community but to the Asian community as well.”

Referencing Hussain’s innovative way of serving naan, Patel added: “It was a wow factor when you sat down for your curry and this giant naan arrived, and then obviously lots of other restaurants copied that concept.

“It was a remarkable vision he had, not just as someone who was able to produce amazing food, but that marketing and entrepreneurial spirit he just had a knack for.”

The Labour MP for Bradford West, Naz Shah, said she was “deeply saddened” by the culinary star’s passing. Posting on X, she said: “A huge loss to his family and the world of business, not just in Bradford but across the UK as his brand reached many cities. His entrepreneurial triumph was exporting the best of Bradford’s curry scene throughout the country.”",shabir hussain celebrity chef known “ king curry ” claimed invented “ hanging naan ” died age 56 hussain founded chain indian restaurants uk owned dozens food venues across north england midlands scotland restaurant akbar ’ announced hussain ’ death social media wednesday said establishments would closed 5pm friday result “ great sadness announce passing shabir hussain founder akbar ’ restaurant group ” post said “ please remember shabir hussain prayers may allah swt grant highest rank jannah bring peace strength family difficult time ” hussain first opened 28seat restaurant bradford 1995 expanding cities across uk including leeds sheffield manchester newcastle glasgow birmingham opened latest restaurant blackburn earlier year chef described “ pioneer indian food world ” claimed year invented “ naan tree ” vertical metal stand holds large naans asian flatbreads speaking ceo club podcast hussain said “ ’ guy invented naan tree – biggest regret could patented … ’ actually used everywhere everybody ” restaurateur said initially designed “ spacesaver ” later turned “ craze ” “ people started coming restaurant see ” said “ idea build heavy base ’ fall bring upwards beginning hooks one side ” told podcast “ put hooks sides hang two naans ” editor asian standard fatima patel described hussain “ generous soft human ” speaking bbc patel said “ revolutionised curry industry went created lots new ways present curry nonasian community asian community well ” referencing hussain ’ innovative way serving naan patel added “ wow factor sat curry giant naan arrived obviously lots restaurants copied concept “ remarkable vision someone able produce amazing food marketing entrepreneurial spirit knack ” labour mp bradford west naz shah said “ deeply saddened ” culinary star ’ passing posting x said “ huge loss family world business bradford across uk brand reached many cities entrepreneurial triumph exporting best bradford ’ curry scene throughout country ”,0.0,0.9788
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/16/standing-desks-may-be-bad-for-your-health-study-suggests,"They have been billed as the ultimate antidote to sitting in front of a screen all day at the office. But a study suggests standing desks, which have soared in popularity in recent years, do not compensate for being inactive and may even increase the risk of conditions such as swollen veins and blood clots in the legs.

Research involving more than 80,000 adults in the UK has also discovered that standing does not reduce the risk of diseases such as stroke and heart failure, despite the widely held belief that it does.

The study, led by the University of Sydney, found that being on your feet for more than two hours a day may increase the risk of developing problems such as deep vein thrombosis and varicose veins. The findings were published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.

Dr Matthew Ahmadi, of the University of Sydney’s faculty of medicine and health, said people who sat or stood for long periods should schedule regular movement throughout the day.

“The key takeaway is that standing for too long will not offset an otherwise sedentary lifestyle and could be risky for some people in terms of circulatory health. We found that standing more does not improve cardiovascular health over the long-term and increases the risk of circulatory issues,” Ahmadi said.

To establish if standing provided any health benefits, the researchers studied data from 83,013 adults who are part of the UK Biobank health records database.

These people did not have heart disease at the start of the study and wore devices on their wrists to track movement. The team found that for every extra 30 minutes spent standing beyond two hours, the risk of circulatory disease increased by 11%.

Standing was not found to reduce the risk of heart conditions such as stroke, heart failure and coronary heart disease, the researchers said.

Prof Emmanuel Stamatakis, the director of the Mackenzie Wearables Research Hub at the University of Sydney, said: “For people who sit for long periods on a regular basis, including plenty of incidental movement throughout the day and structured exercise may be a better way to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

“Take regular breaks, walk around, go for a walking meeting, use the stairs, take regular breaks when driving long distances, or use that lunch hour to get away from the desk and do some movement.”

Emily McGrath, a senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation who was not involved with the research, said the findings highlighted the importance of being active during the working day.

“The more people can avoid being stationary, the better,” she said. “Over the long term, the study showed that standing time was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, however it did have other circulatory health implications for some. It is important to get active to reduce this risk.”",billed ultimate antidote sitting front screen day office study suggests standing desks soared popularity recent years compensate inactive may even increase risk conditions swollen veins blood clots legs research involving 80000 adults uk also discovered standing reduce risk diseases stroke heart failure despite widely held belief study led university sydney found feet two hours day may increase risk developing problems deep vein thrombosis varicose veins findings published international journal epidemiology dr matthew ahmadi university sydney ’ faculty medicine health said people sat stood long periods schedule regular movement throughout day “ key takeaway standing long offset otherwise sedentary lifestyle could risky people terms circulatory health found standing improve cardiovascular health longterm increases risk circulatory issues ” ahmadi said establish standing provided health benefits researchers studied data 83013 adults part uk biobank health records database people heart disease start study wore devices wrists track movement team found every extra 30 minutes spent standing beyond two hours risk circulatory disease increased 11 standing found reduce risk heart conditions stroke heart failure coronary heart disease researchers said prof emmanuel stamatakis director mackenzie wearables research hub university sydney said “ people sit long periods regular basis including plenty incidental movement throughout day structured exercise may better way reduce risk cardiovascular disease “ take regular breaks walk around go walking meeting use stairs take regular breaks driving long distances use lunch hour get away desk movement ” emily mcgrath senior cardiac nurse british heart foundation involved research said findings highlighted importance active working day “ people avoid stationary better ” said “ long term study showed standing time associated increased risk cardiovascular disease however circulatory health implications important get active reduce risk ”,0.0,0.4019
https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/16/cortisol-face-tiktok-cushings-syndrome,"Does your face get puffy sometimes? Do you occasionally experience the emotion known as “stress”? According to some of the planet’s foremost medical thinkers (TikTok influencers), these are not simply inevitable consequences of existence; they are signs that you may have so-called “cortisol face”.

Cortisol is the body’s main stress hormone. According to hundreds of clips on social media, an excess of stress – and, by extension, an excess of cortisol – results in a round, puffy face. “You’re not ugly, you just have cortisol face,” is a popular refrain in these videos. In posts, users share before and after images of themselves in which they go from having a round, full face to a lean one – all jutting cheekbones and sharp jawlines.

“The reason you’re getting a double chin, you have puffy eyelids, and your cheeks are sagging is because your high cortisol is silently changing the way your face looks,” one video claims.

Besides the explicit fat-shaming in these messages, the science doesn’t quite hold up. “‘Cortisol face’ is not a recognized medical term,” explains Dr Priya Jaisinghani, an endocrinologist at New York University’s Langone Health.

Prolonged high levels of cortisol can have adverse health effects. Over time, an excess of cortisol can lead to Cushing’s syndrome, a condition that can result in high blood pressure, bone loss and occasionally type 2 diabetes. But Cushing’s syndrome is relatively rare, experts say.

We asked experts for the truth behind this new wellness term.

What is cortisol and how does it affect our health?

“Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands,” says Dr Adam Friedman, professor and chair of dermatology at the George Washington University school of medicine and health sciences. He explains that it plays an essential role in a number of the body’s functions, including regulating metabolism, managing our immune and stress responses and maintaining blood pressure.

“Without the right amount of cortisol we can’t survive,” says Friedman. But too much of it “is a bad thing”.

Doctors can ascertain your cortisol levels by testing your blood, urine or saliva.

What is Cushing’s syndrome?

There are two types of Cushing’s syndrome, says Dr Maria Fleseriu, director of the pituitary center at Oregon Health & Science University: exogenous (the result of a factor outside the body) and endogenous (the result of a factor inside the body).

Exogenous Cushing’s syndrome is typically the result of steroid treatments, specifically glucocorticoid medications like cortisone and prednisone. These can raise levels of cortisol in the body.

This is far more common than endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, which can be caused by a pituitary tumor or an adrenal gland disorder.

While day-to-day stress can contribute to weight gain, Friedman says, it is unlikely to do so “to the extent seen in medical syndrome like Cushing’s”.

“Cushing’s syndrome is rare,” says Fleseriu, who estimates there are four to five cases of endogenous Cushing’s per million people per year worldwide.

Is cortisol face real?

Sort of, but not in the way it’s generally discussed on TikTok. As Jaisinghani says, it’s not a medical term.

Weight gain in the face and neck is a common symptom of Cushing’s syndrome, but that alone is not enough for a diagnosis, says Fleseriu. “The clinical diagnosis of Cushing’s is very challenging,” she explains. When determining whether a patient has the condition or not, Fleseriu says she looks for “more than one symptom”.

Other symptoms of Cushing’s include pink and purple stretch marks on the stomach, high blood pressure, thin skin that bruises easily, a lump of fat between the shoulders and weight gain in the face and torso while limbs and extremities remain thin.

How does one regulate their cortisol levels?

The risk of developing Cushing’s syndrome is relatively low. But Jaisinghani says people can manage their stress and cortisol levels by tending to their overall health. She suggests “maintaining a nutrient-dense diet, ensuring adequate and high-quality sleep, staying well-hydrated and incorporating stress reduction strategies”.

If one is diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome, treatments vary. If it’s exogenous, Fleseriu warns that it is important not to stop or reduce the use of glucocorticoid medications without the supervision of a doctor. “Stopping steroids immediately could put them in adrenal crisis,” she explains.

In the case of endogenous Cushing’s, patients may take medication, or undergo surgery or radiation to remove any tumors. Generally, these treatments are successful. “We can induce remission in almost everybody right now,” Fleseriu says.

If you do think your cortisol levels are high, don’t turn to TikTok for answers. “If you are concerned about your cortisol levels, it’s important to consult with your doctor,” Jaisinghani says.",face get puffy sometimes occasionally experience emotion known “ stress ” according planet ’ foremost medical thinkers tiktok influencers simply inevitable consequences existence signs may socalled “ cortisol face ” cortisol body ’ main stress hormone according hundreds clips social media excess stress – extension excess cortisol – results round puffy face “ ’ ugly cortisol face ” popular refrain videos posts users share images go round full face lean one – jutting cheekbones sharp jawlines “ reason ’ getting double chin puffy eyelids cheeks sagging high cortisol silently changing way face looks ” one video claims besides explicit fatshaming messages science ’ quite hold “ ‘ cortisol face ’ recognized medical term ” explains dr priya jaisinghani endocrinologist new york university ’ langone health prolonged high levels cortisol adverse health effects time excess cortisol lead cushing ’ syndrome condition result high blood pressure bone loss occasionally type 2 diabetes cushing ’ syndrome relatively rare experts say asked experts truth behind new wellness term cortisol affect health “ cortisol steroid hormone produced adrenal glands ” says dr adam friedman professor chair dermatology george washington university school medicine health sciences explains plays essential role number body ’ functions including regulating metabolism managing immune stress responses maintaining blood pressure “ without right amount cortisol ’ survive ” says friedman much “ bad thing ” doctors ascertain cortisol levels testing blood urine saliva cushing ’ syndrome two types cushing ’ syndrome says dr maria fleseriu director pituitary center oregon health science university exogenous result factor outside body endogenous result factor inside body exogenous cushing ’ syndrome typically result steroid treatments specifically glucocorticoid medications like cortisone prednisone raise levels cortisol body far common endogenous cushing ’ syndrome caused pituitary tumor adrenal gland disorder daytoday stress contribute weight gain friedman says unlikely “ extent seen medical syndrome like cushing ’ ” “ cushing ’ syndrome rare ” says fleseriu estimates four five cases endogenous cushing ’ per million people per year worldwide skip past newsletter promotion sign well actually free weekly newsletter practical advice expert insights answers questions live good life enter email address sign privacy notice newsletters may contain info charities online ads content funded outside parties information see newsletters may contain info charities online ads content funded outside parties information see privacy policy use google recaptcha protect website google privacy policy terms service apply newsletter promotion cortisol face real sort way ’ generally discussed tiktok jaisinghani says ’ medical term weight gain face neck common symptom cushing ’ syndrome alone enough diagnosis says fleseriu “ clinical diagnosis cushing ’ challenging ” explains determining whether patient condition fleseriu says looks “ one symptom ” symptoms cushing ’ include pink purple stretch marks stomach high blood pressure thin skin bruises easily lump fat shoulders weight gain face torso limbs extremities remain thin one regulate cortisol levels risk developing cushing ’ syndrome relatively low jaisinghani says people manage stress cortisol levels tending overall health suggests “ maintaining nutrientdense diet ensuring adequate highquality sleep staying wellhydrated incorporating stress reduction strategies ” one diagnosed cushing ’ syndrome treatments vary ’ exogenous fleseriu warns important stop reduce use glucocorticoid medications without supervision doctor “ stopping steroids immediately could put adrenal crisis ” explains case endogenous cushing ’ patients may take medication undergo surgery radiation remove tumors generally treatments successful “ induce remission almost everybody right ” fleseriu says think cortisol levels high ’ turn tiktok answers “ concerned cortisol levels ’ important consult doctor ” jaisinghani says,0.0034602076124567475,0.8871
https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/16/why-joker-folie-a-deux-2-lose-money-and-how-did-it-cost-so-much-in-the-first-place,"To quote Heath Ledger’s version of the clown prince of crime, maybe some wag should be scrawling “Why so serious?” on glass-fronted offices at Warner Bros Discovery this week, as executives there contemplate the box-office implosion of Joker: Folie à Deux. A catastrophic $37.7m opening weekend, the largest second-weekend drop for a DC film (81%), a worldwide take currently standing at a piddling $165m … how has the studio gone from the 2019 original, a billion-grosser that was then the highest earning R-rated film, to this?

If nothing else, the Joker is proving true to his reputation as an agent of chaos. But he is also the most beloved of comic-book villains from a storied franchise; a draw almost on par with Batman himself, making the disaster all the more unthinkable. With bubonic word of mouth, Joker: Folie à Deux is now projected to lose $125m-200m, depending on whose budget estimate you believe. If it’s the $300m figure being generally touted for production and marketing, then this is clearly what has hobbled the film; it would leave it needing as much as $475m to break even. Risky reinventions of hallowed pop-cultural icons are a lot more feasible on the first film’s sensible $60m budget.

$300m is a shocking amount. The money is up on the screen in the sense that director Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix were both paid $20m and supporting actor Lady Gaga $12m; over a quarter of the $200m production budget. But other than beautiful lighting and cinematography, and the climactic sequence, the film doesn’t look outrageously lavish. A cloistered affair set largely in Arkham State Hospital and the courtroom, there’s virtually nothing in the way of extended CGI pyrotechnics to explain the spend. The likeliest explanation is that it was a big bet born out of pandemic desperation for a surefire hit when cinemas reopened.

It seems doubly shocking in the light of Phillips and Phoenix choosing to make the film a musical – reportedly first considering it as a Broadway play. (The original’s staircase dance probably should have served as a warning.) Even on paper, the genre doesn’t promise the kind of returns obliged by the budget, unless you’re a children’s animation. And the sideways step out of realism into a cracked-voice travesty-musical was never likely to connect with the original’s core audience of Joker fanboys, let alone the embittered incel quotient whose preoccupations it channelled. Nor do you imagine that Lady Gaga – fine as she is in the role – corresponds to what they’re accustomed to with past psycho-hottie depictions of Harley Quinn.

It’s not Phillips and Phoenix’s fault that their top-heavy jamboree arrived on the wrong side of the superhero slump that has afflicted both DC and Marvel. Nor that it has lost the lightning-in-a-bottle factor from when Joker popped up mid-Trump presidency in 2019. Applying references to Scorsese toxic masculinity classics Taxi Driver and King of Comedy like an Instagram filter, it touched with exploitation-flick glee on themes of emasculation and repression, vicarious living through entertainment, and demagoguery’s potential. But it is on the pair that the lugubrious sequel struggles for much of its runtime to tap similar energies. It’s largely concerned with a dank deconstruction of the Joker persona, and hammering the audience over the head with further facile point-scoring about the American addiction to fame.

Phillips evidently wanted to course-correct after accusations that he had indulged toxic fandom in the first film. Having Arthur Fleck definitively dismiss the Joker as a pathetic psychological crutch certainly gets his point across.

But chastising the fanbase so openly is tantamount to box office self-harm (probably why the director refused to test-screen Joker: Folie à Deux). The impunity of a $300m budget seems to have led Phillips to mistake this for an auteur film, and shooting during a period of regime change at both Warner and DC reportedly allowed him to operate with weak oversight. According to Variety, he refused to liaise with new DC heads James Gunn and Peter Safran, saying: “With all due respect to them, this is kind of a Warner Bros movie.” But he also pushed back on new Warner president David Zaslav’s suggestions for lowering the budget, including moving the shoot to London rather than Los Angeles.

The film’s nosedive will have repercussions for the still-floundering DC and beyond. This kind of overly conceptual punt will surely become verboten in blockbusters for some time, and you wonder if it will force more conservative reimaginings of other returning icons, particularly Bond. It’s another question whether this almighty flop will give pause for thought in Hollywood about squeezing beloved IP until it has no more juice to give. Could Phillips’ sluggishness in converting realism into expressionism be something to do with the fact that this is the fifth major outing for the Joker in just over 15 years?

Maybe, with his 1970s lodestars, Phillips is currently thinking of the Folie à Deux debacle as a great act of subversion within the corporate studio system; the lunatics taking over the asylum, in the vein of Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider’s anarchic BBS outfit. Or maybe the film’s mood and message has simply come a few months too early. It has its powerful moments: Fleck’s final eruption of involuntary laughter even after renouncing his alter ego suggests a deep irremediable violence lodged inside America’s sternum. If Trump gets elected, or disputes a Harris presidency, Phillips’ banquet of cold psychological vomit may come to seem horribly on the money.
